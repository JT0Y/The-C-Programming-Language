    The type int means that the variables listed are integers, by contrast with
    float, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional
    part. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are
    using; 16-bit ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are
    32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six
    significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10-38 and 10+38
